ASP.NET Core 5 with Vue.js 3 Project

Throughout this project I've learned how to:

- Apply clean architecture to an ASP.NET Core 5, which improves the ability to build a highly scalable and testable application in the long term
- Handle any HTTP requests sent by any client-side applications and process and save them in any type of relational database using EF Core
- To apply CQRS, MediatR, and Pipeline Behavior. The MediatR package makes the CQRS pattern easy to do in ASP.NET Core. The Pipeline Behavior package allows you to run a number of methods, such as validations or loggings, in a command before and after a handler processes it
- Use the the FluentValidation package, a powerful library for validating your models
- Use the AutoMapper package, a library that allows you to map an object to another object by writing a few lines of code

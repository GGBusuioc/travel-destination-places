ASP.NET Core 5 with Vue.js 3 Project

Throughout this project I've learned how to:

- Apply clean architecture to an ASP.NET Core 5, which improves the ability to build a highly scalable and testable application in the future
- Handle any HTTP requests sent by any client-side applications and process and save them in any type of relational database using EF Core
